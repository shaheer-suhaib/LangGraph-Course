      "» To introduce the collaborative nature of the therapeutic relationship \n",
      "What is Orienting a Patient to Therapy, and Why Is This Process Important? \n",
      "Orienting the patient to therapy involves: \n",
      "• A discussion of the theory underlying brief CBT \n",
      "• A description of how the presenting problems can be conceptualized and treated with this \n",
      "approach \n",
      "• Education about the structure, format, and expectations of therapy \n",
      "Orientation for brief CBT involves a discussion of the focused and time-limited nature of the \n",
      "therapy, plus the provider’s rationale for selecting brief CBT to treat a particular problem. As \n",
      "noted in Module 1, this rationale includes the strong research basis of brief CBT and the fact \n",
      "that it is an empirically supported treatment. \n",
      "Many patients have little, if any, exposure to psychotherapy other than examples in the \n",
      "popular media. Although media may be a good avenue for disseminating innovative \n",
      "treatment strategies and therapies, there is an abundance of misinformation that patients may \n",
      "be exposed to. Conveying the legitimate science of CBT in ways that your patients can \n",

      "Negotiating the amount of time the patient will need to be in therapy is also important. For \n",

      "However, the amount of time in therapy and the number of days a week can be reassessed \n",
      "periodically and adjusted to meet the needs of the patient (see Module 8 – Goal Setting). \n",
      "Discussing Symptoms and Diagnostic Issues with the Patient \n",
      "Most patients want to know how they have been diagnosed. Explain the disorder in terms of \n",
      "cognitive and behavioral symptoms to clarify how CBT will directly address their problems. \n",
      "Giving patients descriptions of common symptoms of their disorder can also be helpful. \n",
      "In-Session Example 7.1 \n",
      "Example: There are cognitive and behavioral aspects of feeling depressed. \n",
      "Cognitive characteristics of depression include having negative thoughts about yourself, such \n",

We'll focus on that, and if we have time, we can touch on other things.  It's important to me that we work together on this, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you think today's session should go.  Afterward, I'd also appreciate your feedback on how things went – was there anything that felt unclear or that you'd like to do differently next time?\n",
